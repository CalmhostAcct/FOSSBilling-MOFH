## üß† Usage Notes

- The module uses the **MOFH XML API** for all major functions:
- `/xml-api/version`
- `/xml-api/createacct`
- `/xml-api/suspendacct`
- `/xml-api/unsuspendacct`
- `/xml-api/removeacct`
- `/xml-api/changepackage`
- `/xml-api/passwd`

- The **`listpkgs`** function uses the **JSON API** endpoint:
```

[https://panel.myownfreehost.net/json-api/listpkgs](https://panel.myownfreehost.net/json-api/listpkgs)

```

- Unsupported operations such as IP or username changes will return standardized FOSSBilling `Server_Exception` messages.
